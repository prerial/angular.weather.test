Develop a JavaScript application that uses the Current Weather API 
from OpenWeatherAPI[0] that satisfies the attached mocks.

Requirements
 General
	1. You MUST use a JavaScript framework - AngularJS, EmberJS, 
a react-inspired framework such as Flux, Fluxxor, Redux, etc.  
	2. You MUST use a CSS preprocessor.
 	3. Reproduce the mocks and interactions.
 	4. There should be 2 routes, home and weather.
 	5. The 3 horizontal lines (hamburger icon) should open and close 
the left-hand navigation bar.
 	6. The breadcrumbs should update to the current route.
 	7. Unit tests are required.
	8. Minified and concatenated version should be generated.
 
 Nice to have
	1. Usage of some task manager and/or build system 
for http-server execution, code minification and concatenation process.

 Weather route specific
 	1. When the 'Go' button is pressed, 
please disable the button and show a loading image until the request is satisfied.
	2. Results:
		a. Current Weather should map to the current 
weather API parameter â€˜Weather Condition within the group)
		b. Last Reading, Sunrise, Sunset should be a date in 
the format (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss)
		c. Temperature should be in Fahrenheit

Acceptance Tests
 Case 1
 	City: New York
	State NY
	
	Results will show the current weather

 Case 2
 	City: koajfwe 
 	State: JJK
	
	Results will show error message returned from OpenWeatherAPI
	
 Case 3:
 	City: New York
	State: NY
	
	During the API request, assume there was an error with the API and a HTTP status code of 500 is returned.  
	Please handle this and display a generic error message.

Remarks:
1. There is no search by State at http://openweathermap.org - I used search by State ZIP instead
2. http://openweathermap.org is not open publc anymore

Created APPID in order to use.

APPID=b878b1f241d4af90168ce82b179cb2c3

http://localhost:3000/index.min.html - uses minified js and css

http://localhost:3000/ - normal, dev version
